# MouseWarp

MouseWarp makes your mouse wrap around the screen — when it goes off one edge, it appears on the opposite side.

## Features
- Seamlessly wrap mouse pointer across edges of the screen  
- Lightweight, runs in the background  

## Installation
- Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or build from source).  
- Run `MouseWarp.exe`.  

## Usage
- The app will start running in the background.  
- Move your mouse to the edge of the screen → it will appear on the opposite side.  
- To stop MouseWarp:  
  - Close it from the **system tray** (if visible), or  
  - End the process from **Task Manager**.  

## Advanced Setup
**Autostart on Windows**:  

1. Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`  
2. Copy a shortcut of `MouseWarp.exe` into that folder  

MouseWarp will now launch automatically when Windows starts.  

## Configuration
Currently, MouseWarp has no config file.  
Future versions may allow customizing wrap behavior.
